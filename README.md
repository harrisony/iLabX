# iLabX
This repository is designed to distribute the content for the edX course iLabX.  
In the master-branch there is a list with available branches, each representing a run of the course.  

Each branch has two additional folders **Descriptions** and **Setups**. The Descriptions folder contains the lab descriptions while the Setups folder contains the CORE-setups that are used for each week.
